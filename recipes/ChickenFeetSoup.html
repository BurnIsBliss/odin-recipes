    <h2>The following steps are to be followed to create the one of the most sought after delicacies in the world:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Get ur chicken feet from your trusted vendor/butcher (the more dirty the feet the more tastier the soup will be)</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Hoping that you have secured all the necessary ingredients for a basic soup. We will dive down to create the broth:</p>
            <li>Step 2.1</li>
                <p>In a pan get some Chicken blood (for color) and water and heat it until boiling hot temperature.</p>
            <li>Step 2.2</li>
                <p>Add your spices and ur condiments to taste to this solution.</p>
            <li>Step 2.3</li>
                <p>Keep an eye on the mixture so that it does not evaporate entirely, cause we are trying to make our broth.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Add your UNCLEANED Chicken legs into your broth. And let it sit there for a significant amount of time. Let the dirt and microbes get into the broth to bring the flavours together.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Serve it hot in a soup bowl.</p>
        <h2><u>Chef's Note:</u> Add more blood according to your taste and appetite. Recommended to have it hot.</h2>
